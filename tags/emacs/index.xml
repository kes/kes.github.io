      <title>Sorting in Emacs with Elisp</title>

      <description>How would you sort lines in a text file by length?&#xA;I came across a post on X with about thirty full names, mostly well-known authors. The OP asked which one was everyone’s favorite. The interesting part: the names weren’t sorted alphabetically, but by length. When asked how they did it, the OP said it was done by hand.&#xA;Manual is fine for short lists. It becomes tedious very quickly.</description>

      <description>Emacs is implemented in elisp (most of it). Extending, modifying or customizing emacs is also done in elisp. (However, some of emacs is written in C.),&#xA;As of Emacs 25 it is possible to extend emacs by writing modules in C.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s look at a simple example using the notes from https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Module-Initialization.html&#xA;Start the Module A module must start with the following:&#xA;#include &amp;lt;emacs-module.h&amp;gt; int plugin_is_GPL_compatible; After that, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty easy to create a test function.</description>
