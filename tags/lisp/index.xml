      <title>FRACTRAN: John Conway’s Ridiculous Little Programming Language</title>

      <description>Some months back I learned about an esoteric programming language created by mathematician John Conway. Conway also created the well-known Game of Life.&#xA;The language is called FRACTRAN (there’s a wonderful introductory lecture by Conway himself here).&#xA;Very simply, a FRACTRAN program is an ordered list of positive fractions&#xA;\[ f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_k \]&#xA;and an initial integer \( n \).&#xA;The program runs like this:&#xA;Find the first fraction \( f_i \) in the list such that \( n \cdot f_i \) is an integer, and replace \( n \) with that new integer.</description>

      <description>Does it all really come down to Cogito, ergo sum?&#xA;“I think, therefore I am,” Descartes wrote that as he wrestled with radical skepticism.&#xA;For me, it’s just as true—maybe truer—to say: “I learn, therefore I am.”&#xA;The other day, I was reading part of the SBCL manual.&#xA;I was struck by how difficult it was to understand—not because the manual is poorly written, but because manuals, like textbooks, assume a certain level of knowledge.</description>

      <title>Common Lisp Lambdas and Macros</title>

      <description>I was thinking about lambdas and closures the other day (&amp;lsquo;cause after all, why not?), and I was looking at Paul Graham&amp;rsquo;s excellent ANSI Common Lisp &amp;ndash; in chapter one he begins by asking, &amp;ldquo;why learn Lisp?&amp;rdquo; And he shows some C and Lisp code for summing the integers less than n, like so:&#xA;int sum (int n){ int i, s = 0; for (i=0; i&amp;lt; n; i++) s += i; return s; } And, then Common Lisp:</description>

      <title>Emacs Modules</title>

      <description>Emacs is implemented in elisp (most of it). Extending, modifying or customizing emacs is also done in elisp. (However, some of emacs is written in C.),&#xA;As of Emacs 25 it is possible to extend emacs by writing modules in C.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s look at a simple example using the notes from https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Module-Initialization.html&#xA;Start the Module A module must start with the following:&#xA;#include &amp;lt;emacs-module.h&amp;gt; int plugin_is_GPL_compatible; After that, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty easy to create a test function.</description>

      <description>Loop is a massive DSL buried in Common Lisp. It&amp;rsquo;s possible because of Lisp&amp;rsquo;s macro facility, but that&amp;rsquo;s for another time.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ll try to explain it a bit, but nothing exhaustive. Just enough to give a foundation for additional exploring loop in the hyperspec.&#xA;The Fundamental Idea From https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/06_aaaa.htm&#xA;A simple loop form is one that has a body containing only compound forms. Each form is evaluated in turn from left to right.</description>

      <description>The problem can be found here: https://projecteuler.net/problem=6&#xA;Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.&#xA;Once the formula for both is known, the sum of the squares, [n(n+1)(2n+1)]/6 and the sun of the first n numbers, (2n(n+1))/2 the solution is trival:&#xA;(defun formula/sum-of-squares (n) (/ (* n (+ n 1) (+ (* 2 n) 1)) 6)) (defun formula/square-of-the-sum (n) (expt (/ (* n (+ n 1)) 2) 2)) (defun formula/diff (n) (- (formula/square-of-the-sum n) (formula/sum-of-squares n))) (formula/diff 100)</description>

      <description>You can find the problem here: https://projecteuler.net/problem=7&#xA;The problem statement:&#xA;By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13 we can see that the 6th prime is 13.&#xA;What is the 10001st prime number?&#xA;Consider an array like this:&#xA;n a[n] 0 0 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 0 5 1 6 0 7 1 8 0 9 0 10 0 11 1 12 0 13 1 where n (the index of the array) is the number of interest – So, is the number prime?</description>

      <description>Problem number five can be found here: https://projecteuler.net/problem=5&#xA;Problem statement:&#xA;2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.&#xA;What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all the numbers 1 to 20?&#xA;What&amp;rsquo;s wanted is the least common multiple of all numbers 2-20.&#xA;If you would like see a number of different ways the LCM can be calculated, go to: Calculator Soup</description>
