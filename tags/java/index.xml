      <description>I was thinking about lambdas and closures the other day (&amp;lsquo;cause after all, why not?), and I was looking at Paul Graham&amp;rsquo;s excellent ANSI Common Lisp &amp;ndash; in chapter one he begins by asking, &amp;ldquo;why learn Lisp?&amp;rdquo; And he shows some C and Lisp code for summing the integers less than n, like so:&#xA;int sum (int n){ int i, s = 0; for (i=0; i&amp;lt; n; i++) s += i; return s; } And, then Common Lisp:</description>

      <description>Note: This began as an explainer for seasoned engineers learning Java 8. It’s not exhaustive, but it is designed to make lambdas intuitive—and maybe even fun.&#xA;TLDR; A lambda is an anonymous function—a piece of executable code you can create inline, pass around, and call later.&#xA;Lisp created them decades ago. Java added them in 2014 (Java 8), built on top of functional interfaces.&#xA;Let’s see how they work in Lisp first, then translate that understanding into Java.</description>

      <title>Java: Counting non-Duplicate Items</title>

      <description>This problem came up at codewars.com.&#xA;Given the goal to count items in a list, and with the caveat that some of the items will be duplicated, and these additional duplicates are not to be counted. So, a count of unique items is what is wanted.&#xA;Such problems always make me think of a hash table, or an &amp;ldquo;associative array.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;But there are more details: the items to count are in an array, and the items themselves are also an array &amp;ndash; so a two dimensional array, something like:</description>
