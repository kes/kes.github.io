      <description>Some time ago, I was on a reddit thread and someone commented that they knew python and wondered if they should learn C …&#xA;I thought everybody knew C! ;)&#xA;Back in the day, C was my third or fourth programming language.&#xA;With the mention of C I just had to break out my copy of The C Programming Language. Unfortunately, my original copy is long gone but I have the second edition.</description>

      <description>Not all the documents that I create are computational — but when they are I use Emacs, Org Mode, and Babel&#xA;Computational documents are a mixture of text and executable code. And the process of creating them, bringing together the text and code is called &amp;ldquo;weaving.&amp;rdquo; But sometimes, you want to separate the text and code. This is called &amp;ldquo;tangling.&amp;rdquo; For more see, extracting source code.&#xA;This turns out that tangling is pretty useful when you want to maintain one source of code for display and for processing, maintaining the DRY principle</description>

      <title>What&#39;s a Lambda?</title>

      <description>This document is a brief investigation into the question:&#xA;What is a lambda?&#xA;And, in our context, more specifically, what is lambda in computer languages, and even more specifically, what is lambda in Java.&#xA;Java added lambda expressions in 2014 (see Java SE 8).&#xA;Caveat: Nothing in this document is meant to be exhaustive. It&amp;rsquo;s not the final word on anything. And there most likely are errors in it – in fact, most definitely.</description>
