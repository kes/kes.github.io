      <description>Some time ago, I was on a reddit thread and someone commented that they knew python and wondered if they should learn C â€¦&#xA;I thought everybody knew C! ;)&#xA;Back in the day, C was my third or fourth programming language.&#xA;With the mention of C I just had to break out my copy of The C Programming Language. Unfortunately, my original copy is long gone but I have the second edition.</description>
