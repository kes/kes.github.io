      <description>Project Euler has a Fractran problem.&#xA;If you don&amp;rsquo;t know about John Conway&amp;rsquo;s Fractran you can look here and here.&#xA;You can find the problem here: https://projecteuler.net/problem=308&#xA;I have reproduced it here:&#xA;A program written in the programming language Fractran consists of a list of fractions.&#xA;The internal state of the Fractran Virtual Machine is a positive integer, which is initially set to a seed value. Each iteration of a Fractran program multiplies the state integer by the first fraction in the list which will leave it an integer.</description>

      <description>Some time ago, I was on a reddit thread and someone commented that they knew python and wondered if they should learn C â€¦&#xA;I thought everybody knew C! ;)&#xA;Back in the day, C was my third or fourth programming language.&#xA;With the mention of C I just had to break out my copy of The C Programming Language. Unfortunately, my original copy is long gone but I have the second edition.</description>
