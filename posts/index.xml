      <description>Okay, this is the second question from the &amp;ldquo;Top Interview 150.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;If you&amp;rsquo;re new here:&#xA;Working on leetcode.com there&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;ldquo;Top Interview 150&amp;rdquo; list of problems. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure where the list comes from, but no matter. Doing a quick count it looks like there are around 20 hard problems,about 40 easy, and about 90 medium.&#xA;So that&amp;rsquo;s the goal. Do all 150 problems.&#xA;Remove Element Level: easy&#xA;Read the problem description.</description>

      <description>Recently (11/16/2024) I upgraded my amateur radio (ham) license from General to Amateur Extra.&#xA;Over the years, the FCC Amateur Radio Service has had a number of license classes, each providing different privileges. Currently there are three classes: Technician, General, and the Amateur Extra. (And for those who are old enough to remember such things, there is no longer a Morse code requirement – though this mode is still popular on the amateur radio bands where Morse code enthusiasts will find a warm reception.</description>

      <description>Emacs is implemented in elisp (most of it). Extending, modifying or customizing emacs is also done in elisp. (However, some of emacs is written in C.),&#xA;As of Emacs 25 it is possible to extend emacs by writing modules in C.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s look at a simple example using the notes from https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Module-Initialization.html&#xA;Start the Module A module must start with the following:&#xA;#include &amp;lt;emacs-module.h&amp;gt; int plugin_is_GPL_compatible; After that, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty easy to create a test function.</description>

      <description>This problem came up at codewars.com.&#xA;Given the goal to count items in a list, and with the caveat that some of the items will be duplicated, and these additional duplicates are not to be counted. So, a count of unique items is what is wanted.&#xA;Such problems always make me think of a hash table, or an &amp;ldquo;associative array.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;But there are more details: the items to count are in an array, and the items themselves are also an array – so a two dimensional array, something like:</description>

      <description>I want to use std::format in C++. If I just compile with g++ without any command line options, I get an error – format is not found. I&amp;rsquo;m using GCC version 13, and C++20 is supported. What gives? (GCC supports different C++ standards, for details see: https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html.)&#xA;(Oh, and don&amp;rsquo;t be confused by the GCC version and the C++ standard – these are different things. You can use the GCC version 13 compiling to C++ Standard 17 (for example; or 11, or 20, or…).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve started writing a C compiler, and I&amp;rsquo;m using Nora Sandler&amp;rsquo;s book, Writing a C Compiler.1 Recommended. Created github repository for the project: https://github.com/kes/c-compiler.&#xA;Back in the day, I was taught compilers using the &amp;ldquo;Dragon book.&amp;rdquo; (Compilers2)&#xA;After a brief examination of Sandler&amp;rsquo;s book, what I like is that while it&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;ldquo;detailed guide,&amp;rdquo; and (so far at least) with plenty of technical insight, nevertheless the reader is left to his own devices.</description>

      <description>Project Euler has a Fractran problem.&#xA;If you don&amp;rsquo;t know about John Conway&amp;rsquo;s Fractran you can look here and here.&#xA;You can find the problem here: https://projecteuler.net/problem=308&#xA;I have reproduced it here:&#xA;A program written in the programming language Fractran consists of a list of fractions.&#xA;The internal state of the Fractran Virtual Machine is a positive integer, which is initially set to a seed value. Each iteration of a Fractran program multiplies the state integer by the first fraction in the list which will leave it an integer.</description>

      <description>Loop is a massive DSL buried in Common Lisp. It&amp;rsquo;s possible because of Lisp&amp;rsquo;s macro facility, but that&amp;rsquo;s for another time.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ll try to explain it a bit, but nothing exhaustive. Just enough to give a foundation for additional exploring loop in the hyperspec.&#xA;The Fundamental Idea From https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/06_aaaa.htm&#xA;A simple loop form is one that has a body containing only compound forms. Each form is evaluated in turn from left to right.</description>

      <description>You can find the problem here: https://projecteuler.net/problem=7&#xA;The problem statement:&#xA;By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13 we can see that the 6th prime is 13.&#xA;What is the 10001st prime number?&#xA;Consider an array like this:&#xA;n a[n] 0 0 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 0 5 1 6 0 7 1 8 0 9 0 10 0 11 1 12 0 13 1 where n (the index of the array) is the number of interest – So, is the number prime?</description>

      <description>Some time ago, I was on a reddit thread and someone commented that they knew python and wondered if they should learn C …&#xA;I thought everybody knew C! ;)&#xA;Back in the day, C was my third or fourth programming language.&#xA;With the mention of C I just had to break out my copy of The C Programming Language. Unfortunately, my original copy is long gone but I have the second edition.</description>

      <description>Not all the documents that I create are computational — but when they are I use Emacs, Org Mode, and Babel&#xA;Computational documents are a mixture of text and executable code. And the process of creating them, bringing together the text and code is called &amp;ldquo;weaving.&amp;rdquo; But sometimes, you want to separate the text and code. This is called &amp;ldquo;tangling.&amp;rdquo; For more see, extracting source code.&#xA;This turns out that tangling is pretty useful when you want to maintain one source of code for display and for processing, maintaining the DRY principle</description>

      <description>This document is a brief investigation into the question:&#xA;What is a lambda?&#xA;And, in our context, more specifically, what is lambda in computer languages, and even more specifically, what is lambda in Java.&#xA;Java added lambda expressions in 2014 (see Java SE 8).&#xA;Caveat: Nothing in this document is meant to be exhaustive. It&amp;rsquo;s not the final word on anything. And there most likely are errors in it – in fact, most definitely.</description>
