      <description>The problem can be found here: https://projecteuler.net/problem=6&#xA;Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.&#xA;Once the formula for both is known, the sum of the squares, [n(n+1)(2n+1)]/6 and the sun of the first n numbers, (2n(n+1))/2 the solution is trival:&#xA;(defun formula/sum-of-squares (n) (/ (* n (+ n 1) (+ (* 2 n) 1)) 6)) (defun formula/square-of-the-sum (n) (expt (/ (* n (+ n 1)) 2) 2)) (defun formula/diff (n) (- (formula/square-of-the-sum n) (formula/sum-of-squares n))) (formula/diff 100)</description>

      <description>Problem number five can be found here: https://projecteuler.net/problem=5&#xA;Problem statement:&#xA;2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.&#xA;What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all the numbers 1 to 20?&#xA;What&amp;rsquo;s wanted is the least common multiple of all numbers 2-20.&#xA;We need to factor all the number from 2 to 20. So, let&amp;rsquo;s do some prime factoring!</description>

      <title>The C Programming Language</title>

      <description>Some time ago, I was on a reddit thread and someone commented that they knew python and wondered if they should learn C …&#xA;I thought everybody knew C! ;)&#xA;Back in the day, C was my third or fourth programming language.&#xA;With the mention of C I just had to break out my copy of The C Programming Language. Unfortunately, my original copy is long gone but I have the second edition.</description>

      <description>Not all the documents that I create are computational — but when they are I use Emacs, Org Mode, and Babel&#xA;Computational documents are a mixture of text and executable code. And the process of creating them, bringing together the text and code is called &amp;ldquo;weaving.&amp;rdquo; But sometimes, you want to separate the text and code. This is called &amp;ldquo;tangling.&amp;rdquo; For more see, extracting source code.&#xA;This turns out that tangling is pretty useful when you want to maintain one source of code for display and for processing, maintaining the DRY principle</description>

      <title>What&#39;s a Lambda?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/whatisalambda/</link>

      <description>This document is a brief investigation into the question:&#xA;What is a lambda?&#xA;And, in our context, more specifically, what is lambda in computer languages, and even more specifically, what is lambda in Java.&#xA;Java added lambda expressions in 2014 (see Java SE 8).&#xA;Caveat: Nothing in this document is meant to be exhaustive. It&amp;rsquo;s not the final word on anything. And there most likely are errors in it – in fact, most definitely.</description>
